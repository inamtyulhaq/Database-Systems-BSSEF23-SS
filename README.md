This repository contains the lab manuals and their solutions for the course Database Systems (CC-215).

I worked with Dr. Madiha Khalid as the official Teaching Assistant for the class, BS Software Engineering (Self Support) Fall 2023.

Mainly for students to see the solution alongside an explanation after the labs.

Assignment manuals, Quizzes, and Books are also added to the repository. 

Not for any commercial use.
